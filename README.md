# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview 
For the analysis, we were asked to use SQL to determine the number of employees retiring per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We first retrieved data on employees who were born between 1952 and 1955 and the titles they hold within the company, then from this table, we narrowed the results down by only looking at the most recent position they held within the company upon their retirement. Using the unique_titles query, we obtained the most recent titles of the employees who are set to retire. Lastly, we created the table containing retiring individuals who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
### Results 
- About 133,776 employees within the company were born between 1952 and 1955, therefore, about 133,776 individuals holding different titles are set to retire from the company.
- Upon narrowing the results down to focus on the most recent title held by employees promoted within the company, the number of retiring employees was found to be 72,458.
